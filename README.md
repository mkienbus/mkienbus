# Welcome to my GitHub page!

## A quick background:
I graduated from a full stack web development course through Flatiron School in April, 2022. I studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SQL, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, and Ruby on Rails.

I started as a front end contractor for PropBox Software in December, 2024. I am helping build their application following designs in Figma by using TypeScript, React.js, and TailwindCSS

In November, 2023, I started as a front end developer for [NovaEdge Technology](https://www.novaedgeusa.com/). I'm helping build their site and user interface for an exciting new AI product following designs in Figma by using TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

From March of 2023, to June of 2024 I worked as a pro bono developer with the [HUNTwallet](https://www.huntwallet.com/) team. I worked primarily with TypeScript, Next.js, and custom CSS to complete ticket items.

I also received my Bachelor's degree from Colorado State University in Sociology with a concentration in Criminal Justice in 2014, I am an Army Veteran, and I currently work in law enforcement.
