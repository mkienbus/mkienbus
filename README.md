# Welcome to my GitHub page!

## A quick background:
I graduated from a full stack web development course through Flatiron School in April, 2022. I studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SQL, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, and Ruby on Rails. 

In March, 2023, I started working as a pro bono developer with the [HUNTwallet](https://www.huntwallet.com/) team. I work primarily with TypeScript, Next.js, and custom CSS to complete ticket items. 

In November, 2023, I started as an intern for [NovaEdge Technology](https://www.novaedgeusa.com/). I'm helping build their site and user interface for an exciting new AI product utilizing TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

I also received my Bachelor's degree from Colorado State University in Sociology with a concentration in Criminal Justice in 2014, I am an Army Veteran, and I currently work in law enforcement.
