# Welcome to my GitHub page!

## A quick background:
I graduated from a full stack web development course through Flatiron School in April, 2022. I studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SQL, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, and Ruby on Rails. 

In March, 2023, I started working as a pro bono developer with the [HUNTwallet](https://www.huntwallet.com/) team. I have been completing tasks on my own for their web and mobile apps under the guidance and mentorship of the teamâ€™s technical lead. 

I also received my Bachelor's degree from Colorado State University in Sociology with a concentration in Criminal Justice in 2014, and I currently work in law enforcement.
